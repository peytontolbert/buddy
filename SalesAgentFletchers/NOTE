English Script
Setup and Preparation:

Load necessary settings and create a folder for recordings if it doesn't exist.
Define essential parameters such as sample frequency, recording duration, and load specific models for voice recognition.
Retrieve API keys and configure them for OpenAI and Eleven Labs.
Introduction:

Get the first message, which is an introduction for the sales agent to follow.
Convert this message into speech and play the audio.
Record the audio from the user (sales agent) and transcribe it to text.
Sales Pitch:

Use the transcribed text to create a short sales pitch with the help of GPT-3.5.
Convert the sales pitch response into speech and play it to the user.
Record the user's response and transcribe it.
Ongoing Interaction with Client:

Continue with the following loop until specific criteria are met:
a. Record the user's audio and transcribe it.
b. Parse the client's details such as name and email from the transcription.
c. If both name and email are obtained, proceed to send a farewell message and close the application.
d. Otherwise, update the parsed information with the new client details.
e. Print the current state of the parsed information.
f. Create a response to close the call using GPT-3.5 and the transcribed text.
g. Print the response, convert it to speech, and play it.
h. Increment a counter to keep track of the interaction rounds.
Closing the Interaction:

If the client's name and email are successfully obtained, the application sends a farewell message:
Convert the farewell text to speech.
Play the farewell speech.
Close the application, printing a farewell message with the client's details.
Summary
The script orchestrates a simulated interaction between a sales agent and a client. It guides the sales agent through the introduction, sales pitch, and closing of a call, using GPT-3.5 to generate responses and handle various stages of the conversation.

The agent's speech is recorded and transcribed, allowing the program to parse client details and respond appropriately. If the client's name and email are obtained, the application sends a farewell message and closes.
