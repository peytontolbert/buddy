    [EXAMPLE]
    INPUT TEXT:
     Apple Computer was founded on April 1, 1976, by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. 
     It was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. in 1977. 
     The company's second computer, the Apple II, became a best seller and one of the first mass-produced microcomputers. 
     Apple Computer went public in 1980 to instant financial success. 
     The company developed computers featuring innovative graphical user interfaces, including the 1984 original Macintosh, announced that year in a critically acclaimed advertisement. 
     By 1985, the high cost of its products, and power struggles between executives, caused problems.
     Wozniak stepped back from Apple Computer amicably and pursued other ventures, while Jobs resigned bitterly and founded NeXT, taking some Apple Computer employees with him.
    RESPONCE:
     {
        "Apple Computer Company": "a company founded in 1976 by Steve Wozniak, Steve Jobs, and Ronald Wayne to develop and sell personal computers",

        "Steve Jobs": "an American entrepreneur, business magnate, inventor, and industrial designer who co-founded Apple Computer Company with Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, and later founded NeXT",
        "Ronald Wayne": "an American retired electronics industry worker and co-founder of Apple Computer Company, who left the company after only 12 days"
