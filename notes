Autonomous Cognitive entity
WORKFLOWS: ['VOLITION', 'LISTEN', 'EMOTIONAL ADJUSTMENT', 'ERROR', 'STACK', 'CONNECTTOME', 'WORKINGLOOP']
The agent should learn from its actions.
Several layers of memories: working memorys (~12), thoughts (unfiltered thoughts), memories(consolidated thoughts). Several processes run non-stop to consolidate them.
The main loop is a stack of thoughts (observe) to volition (action)


Listen to discord microservice workflow:
Fetch emotional state -> fetch username thought -> if user exists:
if not -> Set Query -> EmbedQuery -> Upsert Query -> Embed username -> upstart username -> user discovery -> format data2 -> stack2 -> volition 1 
 
->Get relationship thoughts -> concatenate relationship -> relationship memory -> format data ->stack 1 -> manage mrmory -> fetch emotional state -> fetch data -> stack -> volition

I need to have the beginning of main load certain tools,
in the action the entity may use learned tools from a memory storage



add errorhandler to the list_by_class 



TO DO:
remake the original action process
/create workspace
/give tool for internet search: serpapi
read twitter foryou
search link
/write file
/edit file
/read file
local LLM




Create an agent factory with Buddy to complete tasks
Mother agent uses volition to decide on goal

After goal, mother agent will create task









Working Loop 
    ->Volition 
        Goal Management
        Critic&Actor
        Stack->Emotional Adjustment/Memories/Add to working memory (semantic contected thoughts)/memory consolidation


Working Loop: Thoughts(List or Dict) -> Fetch working memory -> working memory -> foreach working memory -> fetch thought -> format output data -> stack thought -> volition -> openai choose next best action -> format data->Stack->Thoughts->Select Action->Take action->Reflect on action->store memory

Based on the details you've provided, here are the key components you need to add to your main.py:

Autonomous Cognitive Entity: This is the main class or object that encapsulates the overall AI model. This could include sub-components for cognitive abilities, emotional state, and action selection (volition).

Memory Management: This will include:
Working Memory: A short-term memory store.
Thoughts: A container for current, unfiltered thoughts.
Memories: A container for longer-term, consolidated thoughts. Procedural (reinforcement learning), semantic (semantic learning), and episodic (episodic learning) 
Consolidation Processes: You'll need to implement some kind of background processes to continuously consolidate the thoughts into memories.

Thought Stack: A stack of thoughts to handle volition (action). This will involve processes to:

Define a prompt based on the process that called the stack
Send a thought to ChatGPT
Embed the thought
Fetch the current emotional state
Update (upsert) the thought
Fetch the thought
Format the output data
Apply an emotional adjustment
Connection Management: Functions to connect and reset the AI's working memory and emotional state. This will include:

Connection to the AI
Reset of the working memory
Updating the user state ("myself")
Resetting the emotional state
Generating an initial thought
Formatting the output
Stacking the first thought
Initial volition
Volition Handling:
