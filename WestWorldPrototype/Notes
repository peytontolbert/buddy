Create a simulation environment for LLM-controlled sims to live in.
Allow a user to register an account and each account is allowed one LLM-sim
They are allowed to give attributes to this LLM-sim and then when they press create, the character will be generated.
The character will be placed in a private room for the user where the user will watching.
The user is allowed to enter the room and talk and interact with the character, or just watch from above.
The character just lives their life as the server is running, interacting with whatever is in their room. For now, all the characters can do is conversate.
The architecture should allow me to add items to the room that can be dropped in and the character could freely interact with.
All interactions with items are done through text.
There is one live public room that users are allowed to place their characters in so that characters may interact with other characters.
For a character to entire a nonhost's private room, they must be given permission when the user attempts to move their character to someone else's private room.
The first items in the game will be a chair and a couch so that people in the rooms may sit down. Construct the game environment like habbo hotel in a isometric grid-style layout.
The characters and users in the room will be circles that fill a space in the grid.
Allow movement and collision detection, only one character/user per space.
